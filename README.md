This is Jay Matthews' (34438777) repository for the weekly learning activities.

It was cloned earlier from given code and modified in previous weeks.

It is missing a comphrensive commit history because I didn't bother with sharing the repository until week 11 required deployment. This is because I hadn't detached it from the original repository it was cloned from, and I didn't want to commit anything to branches linking to that repository.
